# **IMPORTANT NOTE 1 ðŸŸ¢
# Now that you have a good enough understanding of the given data, apply the "Mandatory Operation" given below before solving any of the following questions.
# 
# Mandatory Operations:
# 1. Group the user ratings based on movieId and apply aggregation operations like count and mean on ratings. 
# 2. Apply inner join on dataframe created from movies.csv and the grouped df from step 1.
# 3. Filter only those movies which have more than 50 user ratings (i.e. > 50).
# 
# Above steps will make sure that your data contains only those movies which has recieved more than 50 user ratings.**

# **Group the user ratings based on movieId and apply aggregation operations like count and mean on ratings.**

# **IMPORTANT NOTE 2:**
# You already have a subset of data containing only those movies which has recieved more than 50 user ratings.**
# 
# Using "links.csv", scrape the IMDB reviews of each movie with more than 50 user ratings. "README.md" file contains the required details.
# 
# If you are unable to write the webscraping script yourself, you can request the same by commenting LinkedIn Post.**
